# Fixed fields and fixing subgroups generate complementarily

For a finite Galois extension `M / K`, a subgroup `H ≤ Gal(M/K)` and an intermediate field `E`,
the fixed field of `H` and `E` generate `M` exactly when `H` meets the fixers of `E` trivially.

/-- **A trivial meet of subgroups is a full join of fields.** `M ^ H` and `E` generate `M` exactly
when `H ⊓ Gal(M/E)` is trivial.

This is the Galois correspondence read in both directions: `fixingSubgroup` turns a join of fields
into a meet of subgroups, and `fixedField` turns the trivial subgroup back into `⊤`.

Stated in the `Subgroup` namespace rather than `IntermediateField`, so that `H` — the first
explicit argument, and the one `fixedField` is applied to — carries the dot notation: a consumer
writes `H.fixedField_sup_eq_top_iff E`. -/
