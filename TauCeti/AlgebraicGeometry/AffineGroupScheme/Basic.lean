# The category of affine group schemes over `Spec S`

This file introduces the category of affine group schemes over `Spec S` for a
commutative ring `S` — the full subcategory of group objects in schemes over `Spec S`
whose underlying scheme is affine — together with the `Γ`-direction endpoint of the
reductive-groups roadmap's Layer 0 dictionary, stated for a plain-typed base ring `R`
and an arbitrary structure morphism rather than through `Scheme.Over` instance data:
a commutative `R`-Hopf algebra structure on the global sections of an affine group
scheme `φ : G ⟶ Spec R` (`hopfAlgebraGamma`).

The `Spec`-direction endpoint — the group-object structure on `Spec A` over `Spec R`
for a commutative `R`-Hopf algebra `A` — needs no declaration here: it is Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.instGrpObjSpecAsOverSpec`, and its `Over.mk` spelling is reached by
`inferInstanceAs (GrpObj ((Spec (CommRingCat.of A)).asOver (Spec (CommRingCat.of R))))`
at any use site. Everything consumes the instances of Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry/Group/Affine.lean`.
Affineness enters only as the object property cutting out the full subcategory;
further refinements stay predicates rather than being baked into the category. The
anti-equivalence with commutative `S`-Hopf algebras is in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineGroupScheme/Equivalence.lean`.

/-- The object property on group objects in schemes over `Spec S` selecting those whose
underlying scheme is affine. Over the affine base `Spec S` this is equivalent to the
structure morphism being an affine morphism; over a general base scheme only the
relative notion is correct, so this property must not be transplanted verbatim there. -/

abbrev AffineGroupSchemeCat (S : CommRingCat.{u}) := (affineGroupSchemeProperty S).FullSubcategory

isomorphism induces an isomorphism of underlying schemes, and affineness transfers
along it. -/

automatically, so downstream instance searches need not invoke `property` by hand. -/

/-- Mathlib's Hopf-algebra structure on the global sections of an affine group scheme,
applied at a bundled ring `S : CommRingCat` bound as a variable. Private elaboration
shim, not API: the carrier `↥(CommRingCat.of R)` reduces to `R` before instance
synthesis, after which unification cannot match the bundled instance head, so the
plain-typed goal of `hopfAlgebraGamma` cannot find the instance directly and inlining
this application there fails to elaborate; only the explicitly applied bundled-`S`
form survives, with definitional unfolding closing the gap on application. -/

for an arbitrary structure morphism `φ` with the group structure carried by the object
`Over.mk φ` of schemes over `Spec R` — a statement Mathlib's `Scheme.Over`-instance
form cannot express directly. Not an instance, because `φ` is data that instance
search cannot recover from the goal. -/
