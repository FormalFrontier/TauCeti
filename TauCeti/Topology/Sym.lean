# The symmetric power of a topological space

The `n`-th symmetric power `Sym α n` of a type is the type of unordered `n`-tuples of points of
`α`. It is the quotient of the space `Fin n → α` of ordered tuples by the permutation action, and
this file gives it the corresponding quotient topology, together with the API that a quotient
topology is used through: the quotient map is continuous, and a map out of `Sym α n` is continuous
exactly when its composition with the quotient map is.

The quotient map is `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn`, which reads an ordered tuple as an unordered one. It is
Mathlib's quotient map `Sym.ofVector` composed with `List.Vector.ofFn`; the `Fin n → α` form is the
one that carries a product topology, so it is what the quotient topology is defined against.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn`: the ordered tuple `f : Fin n → α` read as a point of `Sym α n`, and
  `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_surjective`, that every unordered tuple arises this way.
* `TauCeti.Sym.instTopologicalSpace`: the quotient topology on `Sym α n`, coinduced along `ofFn`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.isQuotientMap_ofFn`, `TauCeti.Sym.continuous_ofFn` and
  `TauCeti.Sym.continuous_iff_comp_ofFn`: the resulting quotient-map API.
* `TauCeti.Sym.instCompactSpace`: the symmetric power of a compact space is compact.

Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap needs `Sym^g(Σ)` as a space before it can be
given a complex structure; this file supplies the underlying topology, and
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/SymmetricPower.lean` identifies it, over an algebraically closed
normed field, with affine space through the elementary symmetric functions.
