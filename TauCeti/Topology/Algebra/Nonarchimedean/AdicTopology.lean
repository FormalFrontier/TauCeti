# Powers of the ideal defining an adic topology

For an ideal `I` of a commutative ring `R`, Mathlib's `Ideal.openAddSubgroup` records that each
power `I ^ n` is an open additive subgroup **of `R` carried with the topology `I.adicTopology`**.
A ring is usually met the other way round: it comes with a topology already, and `IsAdic I` is
the statement that this topology *is* the `I`-adic one. The two results here transport the
openness across that equation and add the complementary closedness, so that a ring satisfying
`IsAdic I` may be used directly.

Closedness is the form these are wanted in: an infinite sum all of whose terms lie in `I ^ n`
again lies in `I ^ n`, because `I ^ n` is closed and `tsum_mem` applies. That is how a power
series evaluated at arguments of `I ^ n` is confined to `I ^ n`, in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.MvPowerSeries.Evaluation`.

## Main results

* `IsAdic.isOpen_pow` : in a ring whose topology is `I`-adic, every power of `I` is open.
* `IsAdic.isClosed_pow` : in a ring whose topology is `I`-adic, every power of `I` is closed —
  an open additive subgroup of a topological group being closed.

`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Chabauty/AdicTopology.lean`, where these appear as `IsAdic.isOpen_pow`
and `IsAdic.isClosed_pow` among that development's Mathlib-bound material.
