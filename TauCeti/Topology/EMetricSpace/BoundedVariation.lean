# Limits of total variation bounds

This file transfers eventual upper bounds on the total variations of a family of maps to a
`liminf` bound on the total variation of a pointwise limit.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eVariationOn_le_liminf_of_eventually_le`: an eventual bound on the total variations of
  a family of maps bounds the total variation of a pointwise limit by the `liminf` of the bounds.

/-- If the total variations of the maps `F i` on `s` are eventually bounded by `u i`, then the
total variation on `s` of a pointwise limit of the `F i` is at most `liminf u`. -/
