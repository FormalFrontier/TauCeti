# Tensor powers of the standard representation

This file specializes the diagonal tensor-power construction to the standard representation of
the general linear group. It supplies the tensor powers that underpin the Weyl construction for
polynomial representations.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.tensorPowerRep` is the `d`-fold tensor power of `stdRep`.
* `TauCeti.tensorPowerFDRep` is its bundled finite-dimensional form.

## References

* [Classical groups roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/ClassicalGroups/README.md), Layer 1, “The tensor power representation”.
