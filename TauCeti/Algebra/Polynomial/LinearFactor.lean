# Polynomials of degree at most one with a prescribed root

Mathlib's `Polynomial.dvd_iff_isRoot` factors `X - C x` out of any polynomial vanishing at `x`,
but leaves the cofactor unidentified. When the polynomial has degree at most one the cofactor is
forced to be a constant, so the polynomial is `C γ * (X - C x)` for a single scalar `γ`. That
sharpened form is what is needed to read off the *coefficient* of a linear factor, which
`Polynomial.eq_X_add_C_of_natDegree_le_one` does not give once a root is prescribed.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.exists_eq_C_mul_X_sub_C_of_natDegree_le_one`: a polynomial of `natDegree ≤ 1` with
  root `x` is `C γ * (X - C x)` for some `γ`.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the author's proof, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`), `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean`.
Its consumer is the `x - T` descent map of
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/MordellWeil/XSubT.lean`, where it pins down the line
through a `2`-torsion point.
