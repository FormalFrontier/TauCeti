# Comultiplication as a convolution product

Let `C` be an `R`-algebra carrying a comultiplication. This file records that, in the convolution
monoid of linear maps `C →ₗ[R] C ⊗[R] C`, comultiplication is the convolution product of the two
canonical inclusions `c ↦ c ⊗ₜ 1` and `c ↦ 1 ⊗ₜ c` of `C` into its tensor square.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Coalgebra.comul_eq_convMul_includeLeft_includeRight`: comultiplication as the
  convolution product of the two tensor inclusions.

/-- **Comultiplication is the convolution product of the two tensor inclusions.** In the
convolution monoid of maps `C →ₗ[R] C ⊗[R] C`, the product of `includeLeft` and `includeRight`
multiplies the two legs of `Δ c` back together in order, which is `Δ` itself.

Only the comultiplication *data* is used, so this needs `CoalgebraStruct` rather than
`Coalgebra`: no coalgebra law, bialgebra compatibility or antipode axiom enters. -/
