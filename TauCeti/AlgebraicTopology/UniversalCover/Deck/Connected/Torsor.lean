# Fibres of connected covers as deck torsors

For a preconnected covering map, a nonempty fibre on which the deck group acts
pretransitively is a principal homogeneous space for the deck group. This packages the local
form of the simply transitive fibre action; regular covers specialize it by supplying
pretransitivity on every fibre.

The torsor structure is bookkeeping needed by the universal-covers roadmap Stage 2, where
pointed covers and unpointed covers differ by changing a chosen lift of the basepoint.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Deck.fiberTorsorOfPretransitive`: a nonempty pretransitive fibre of a
  preconnected cover is a `Torsor (Deck p)`.
* `TauCeti.Deck.fiber_sdiv_eq_deckEquivFiberOfSurjective_symm`: fibre division is computed
  by the inverse of the local deck-to-fibre equivalence.
* `TauCeti.Deck.deckEquivFiberOfSurjective_symm_eq_sdiv`: the same characterization in the
  simp direction from old local equivalence API to torsor division.

## References

This supplies a small prerequisite for the regular-cover and pointed/unpointed-cover
bookkeeping in `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2. It builds on the connected
deck-action API in `TauCeti.AlgebraicTopology.UniversalCover.Deck.Connected.Basic` and Mathlib's
generic torsor API (`Mathlib.Algebra.Torsor.Basic`).
